Delete Todo Item: Each todo item has a delete button associated with it, allowing users to remove tasks from the list completely.
Mark as Completed: Todo items can be marked as completed by checking the checkbox next to each item. Completed items will remain in the list with a visual indication to differentiate them from pending tasks.
